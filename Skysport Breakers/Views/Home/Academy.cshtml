    Elite Academy powered by AUT

    The 5 and 10-week programmes are ‘invite-only’ and potential players are identified through the Development Academy and by visiting schools and junior games, as well as talking to people within the basketball community. Trainings are divided into male and females Years 9-10 and Years 11-13, and consist of three sessions per week.





    The high-intensity training with focus on ball handling, shooting, defense, passing, one-on-one and game situations helps players reach their full potential. The rigorous training sessions teaches them the skills, work-ethic and dedication required to become a professional basketball player and opens up the following pathways:





    Youth Academy – Elite Academy – Development Player – Breakers Player


    Youth Academy – Elite Academy – US College
